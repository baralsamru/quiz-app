# Python Quiz App

## Description

This is a simple Python quiz application created as part of my learning journey as a beginner in Python programming. The app is built using the **Tkinter** library to create a graphical user interface (GUI). The quiz app presents a series of computer science-related questions, and the user can enter their answers. The app provides real-time feedback on whether the answer is correct or not, and at the end of the quiz, it displays the user's score.

## Features
